    <h2>History of CSS</h2>
    <p>CSS came first into existence in 1994. CSS evolved all these years and W3C maintained the standards with CSS1, CSS2 and CSS3.

        They were built on top of each other with better adaptability and more features. Each one had issues that were solved by the next standard. CSS got major adaptability issues with multiple web browsers coming up all these years starting from Internet Explorer, Opera, Firefox, Chrome and Edge.</p>

        <ul>
            <li><b>CSS 1</b></li>
            <p>CSS 1 was adapted in 1996. It was difficult and less adapted by then recent browsers such as Internet Explorer 3, Internet Explorer 4 and Netscape 4.x. <br>

                CSS 1 had font properties and specification for typeface and emphasis. The text attributes were supported such as spacing of letters and line of text. <br>
                
                Alignment of text, positioning and tables were also added. Margin, padding, border and positioning for elements was also implemented. This recommendation was not maintained by W3C.</p>
                <li><b>CSS 2</b></li>
                <p>CSS2 is the improvement of CSS1. It removed the not fully interoperable features. It also included the browser extensions. <br>

                    It had many new features such as absolute, relative and fixed positioning of elements. It supported different media types. It also included new font properties such as shadow.</p>

                <li><b>CSS 3</b></li>
                <p>CSS3 is the most recent and currently used. It has XHTML specification. CSS3 has its major focus on modularisation and separation of concerns. <br>

                    Different modules now go through different stages of the recommendation process. CSS3 has support for almost all recent web browsers. <br>
                    
                    It has even included new selectors along with new combinator and new pseudo-elements. <br>
                    
                    CSS3 has several new CSS properties. It supports animation which is not a part of earlier recommendations. <br>
                    
                    There were various properties added such as transforms, gradients, animation and transition for animation effect in the website. <br>
                    
                    Recent add-ons are like border-radius, box-shadow, flex-box and CSS grid.</p>
        </ul>

        <h2>Types of CSS</h2>
        <p>Cascading Style Sheet(CSS) is used to set the style in web pages that contain HTML elements. It sets the background color, font-size, font-family, color, … etc property of elements on a web page. </p>

        <ul>
            <p>There are three types of CSS which are given below: </p>
            <li>Inline CSS</li>
            <li>Internal or Embedded CSS</li>
            <li>External CSS</li>
        </ul>
        <hr>
        <h3>Inline CSS:</h3>
        <p> Inline CSS contains the CSS property in the body section attached with element is known as inline CSS. This kind of style is specified within an HTML tag using the style attribute. </p>
        <h3>Internal or Embedded:</h3>
        <p>This can be used when a single HTML document must be styled uniquely. The CSS rule set should be within the HTML file in the head section i.e the CSS is embedded within the HTML file. </p>
        <h3>External CSS:</h3>
        <p> External CSS contains separate CSS file which contains only style property with the help of tag attributes (For example class, id, heading, … etc). CSS property written in a separate file with .css extension and should be linked to the HTML document using link tag. This means that for each element, style can be set only once and that will be applied across web pages.
            Example: The file given below contains CSS property. This file save with .css extension.</p>
